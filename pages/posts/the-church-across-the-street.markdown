Like a train coming off the track everything seems constant. Then nothing does.

On Thursday we began to feel the rumble. Within a few days, the impact.

I work in an office building downtown. Seventeen stories---filled to the brim with people. After hours the building hosts wedding parties.

We're located in the center of the design district and it shows. When you head downstairs to pick up lunch you'll drown in a sea of smart casual dressed strangers. While you can hear the stress in their conversations it's also clear that they love it. For the most part, they're happy.

You get used to a rhythm in a place like this. You tune in to a particular frequency. Everyday you enter the coffee shop and order your usual from the face you've grown accustomed to. As if you were a wheeltapper the tone of their voice today reminds you of that same voice yesterday. A memorable frequency you can align yourself to.

While you take the elevator up to your floor you anticipate your carefree colleagues routing themselves to the meetings they're late for. You join them. As each one says good morning the familiar frequency fills your ears and you know all these wheels are in good shape.

Monday through Wednesday were the same as the endless weeks before them. The same face at the same cafe hands you the same drink. With that you're tuned to the same frequency as always.

Thursday the impossible happened: You tapped a wheel and it sounded different than the rest.

The train derails.

Months of general disregard turned to a suffocating anxiety overnight.

I was the first person, of those I know, that started to self isolate. While others were still going into the office, I was at home, still wearing my smart casual outfits, not wanting to break the habit.

The train's wheels jump off the track. As the train carriage twists in the air you feel weightless, the gravity of the situation not yet materializing.

Some people were less affected than others. I'd still be able to do my job from the comfort of my home, completely unaffected by this in all ways but one of my choosing: I decided not to leave my apartment. At all.

I live in one of the many shoe box apartments downtown, but I'm lucky enough to have a floor to ceiling glass wall on one side that boasts a beautiful view. While my apartment may be a shoe box the view is expansive enough that I forget. Every afternoon the sun pours in, and every dusk the sky saturates with an effusion of blue, violet, yellow and crimson whose soft gradient contrasts the sharp edges of the monoliths standing before it.

But, before these skyscrapers overtake the view, just across the street is a church. During the day I work at my computer, and though the screen on my desk may be my focal point, the church is ever present in my periphery. A view I admire constantly. Like clockwork---because it is clockwork---the church bells ring loudly every hour. As I hear the bells ring I can feel my mood lift.

It's funny, looking back now, when I first moved into this apartment I worried that the ringing of the church bells might never fade into the background of my daily life, now I worry that they might.

Occasionally while I'm on a call for work the bells will ring, amusing my colleagues. I've been told they can imagine I live in a small town---until a firetruck or police siren ruins the illusion. Having may as well not been within two miles of another person for months, when I stare out at that church it's easy to imagine I'm in a small town too.

When the lock down began I was surprised to hear the church bells still ringing. Less surprising was the absence of people at the church. No longer did it serve as a meeting point for the faithful, but a relic of a recent time that already was beginning to feel distant. I saw the occasional child playing in the parking lot. Now and then someone would stand before the statue in the courtyard and bow their head in prayer. Some prayed for a short moment and carried on with their day. Others would bow their head for what felt like hours.

I wondered what they had to say to God. It's probably best that I don't know. I doubt anyone would pray for such a length of time in appreciation only.

The church stayed that way for a long time. Silence, only broken by those church bells. The only person entering the church coming in through the back door.

It used to be that every weekend as I sat down at my desk with breakfast I would hear the church bells ring. I'd look down to see a crowd of loving family and friends surrounding the newly married couple. They'd loudly cheer as the newly-weds drove off. This always brought me joy, but perhaps I didn't appreciate it as much as I should have.

Now, there are no more weddings at the church.

Instead, there are funerals.

As I sit on a call with colleagues, I hear the church bells toll. I look down to see a crowd of mourning family and friends, a safe distance from one another, surrounding a hearse. The pallbearers carry the casket out of the church. Nobody cheers as the hearse drives off.

Instead, one of them weeps.

On another day I watch as the cars pulled into the parking lot. When the passengers exit the safety of their vehicles they show restraint as they notice the family and friends that arrived before them waiting at the front of the church.

As I watch through the glass I see them deny their instinct. They don't embrace their loved ones, they don't wipe their tears, they don't hold hands as they speak. Instead they delicately approach the group, never coming too near, taking their space in an ever expanding crowd. As each loved one arrives the circle swells to allow a spot for them. They never come together.

Through the glass, I see the church doors open. The group files in one at a time. The church bells toll.

Through the glass, I watch the hearse out front. The driver, leaning against the tinted glass of his side door, shifts his mask below his chin and lights a cigarette.

Through the glass, I witness six men exit the church holding a casket waiting to be received by the hearse.

Everyone is outside again. Even more distance separates them than when they arrived.

Through the distance between them, they watch one another crying, powerless to console the loved ones who need them most.

Through the distance, they struggle to do what's right in the face of what's needed.

Through the distance, they try to find the words that could somehow replace all the emotion and meaning that would come from a simple embrace.

Through the glass, I can't hear their words. Through the distance, their loved ones can't hear them either.

Through the distance---no different than the glass---those mourner's words fail to give relief.

One by one they enter back into their cars. Having been denied the usual closure a funeral brings, they drive home.

Again, the church is silent. But the silence will be broken again soon.

The church bells ring. A familiar frequency fills my ears.

There are no cars in the parking lot.

By the statue in the court yard a stranger prays.

The End.
