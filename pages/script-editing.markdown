Hi there, my name's Connor and I can't wait to read your screenplay.

Reading screenplays for just about a decade, I've helped numerous writers not only improve their drafts, but more importantly, improve their craft.

Honest, critical, and encouraging, I take a long-term interest in my client's careers.

When I read for a production company I'm trying to create business value. When I read for a writer, I'm trying to develop an artist.

I avoid doing standard coverage and prefer taking a deep dive approach. I won't just tell you "Your dialogue comes across a little flat," I'll tell you exactly where it needs a punch up, and why.

Allow me to be the second pair of experienced eyes on your work.

## What I Deliver

<ol>
<li>Line by line analysis.</li>
<p>Going through your script like an editor I will provide you precise feedback on every aspect of your script.</p>
<li>First impressions. (Those first few pages are crucial.)</li>
<p>After I've read the first 10-15 pages of your script I will take a pause and write out my full reflection. I'll state my thoughts unabashed to give you insight into how a producer or script reader might feel reading your script.</p>
<li>Higher level feedback.</li>
<p>Thoughts on story, character development, theme, what is or isn't working, etc. Relating my line by line feedback to a cohesive whole picture outlook.</p>
<li>Personal strengths and weaknesses in your writing.</li>
<p>Every writer is evolving. I will do my best to point you in the right direction, sending educational material that will target your weak spots, and stating your strengths so you can double down on them in the future.</p>
<li>Answering any questions you have.</li>
<p>Either by email or a phone call I'm open to discussing any questions you have further.</p>
</ol>
