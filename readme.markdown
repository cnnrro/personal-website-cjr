# Personal Website

This represents the source for [my personal website "cjr.is"](https://www.cjr.is/).

It started as an experiment to see how far I could get writing a static website generator that primarily uses Make. Turns out pretty far.

I call it Wake--A (W)ebsite generator using GNU m(ake) (Plus a few other tools). But, it's no where near ready to use for anyone by myself.
